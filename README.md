# 📒 Beginner’s Guide to Installing Jupyter Notebook on Windows & Mac (2 Easy Methods)

Whether you're learning Python, diving into data science, or exploring machine learning, **Jupyter Notebook** is one of the best tools to use. It lets you write code, run it instantly, and blend it with text, visuals, and charts—all in your web browser.

This guide covers **two simple ways** to install Jupyter Notebook on your computer:

1. **Using Anaconda** (best for beginners)  
2. **Manual Installation** (with Python and pip via command line)

This guide works for both **Windows and Mac** users, even if you’re not very tech-savvy.

## 🧠 What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is a web-based application that allows you to write Python code in chunks (“cells”) and execute them one by one. It’s perfect for learning, experimentation, analysis, and visualization.

## ✅ Method 1: Install Jupyter Notebook Using Anaconda (Recommended for Beginners)

**Anaconda** is an all-in-one distribution of Python that includes Jupyter Notebook and other essential data science tools like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

### 💻 Steps (Windows & Mac)

#### 1. **Download Anaconda**

Visit: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)  
Choose **Windows** or **Mac**, and download the latest **Python 3.x** version.


#### 2. **Install Anaconda**

- **Windows**: Double-click the `.exe` file  
- **Mac**: Open the `.pkg` file

Follow the setup steps. Stick with the default settings unless you’re an advanced user.


#### 3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

After installing:

- Open **Anaconda Navigator** or **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) / **Terminal** (Mac)
- Click **Launch** in Navigator, or type:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 📂 Where Does Jupyter Launch From?

When you launch Jupyter Notebook from the **Anaconda Prompt (Windows)** or **Terminal (Mac)**, it opens in the **current folder** you are in:

- On **Windows**, this is usually:  
  ```
  C:\Users\yourname
  ```
- On **Mac**, this is usually:  
  ```
  /Users/yourname
  ```

If you want Jupyter to open in another location (e.g., a specific project folder), do this **before launching**:

#### 🔁 Example – Change Directory First

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt (Windows)** or **Terminal (Mac)**
2. Navigate to the folder you want:

   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\yourname\Documents\MyProjects
     ```
   - **Mac**:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Documents/MyProjects
     ```

3. Then launch Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🔧 Method 2: Manual Installation (No Anaconda Required)

Prefer a more lightweight setup? You can install Jupyter manually using Python and pip.

### 1. **Install Python**

#### 🔹 Windows:

Open **Command Prompt** and type:

```bash
python
```

If Python isn’t installed, the **Microsoft Store** will open and prompt you to install it.


Or download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

✅ **Be sure to check "Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

_Image Placeholder: Screenshot showing "Add to PATH" checkbox_

#### 🔹 Mac:

- Download from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
- Install and verify with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### 2. **Install pip**

> 💡 **What is pip?**  
> `pip` is Python’s package manager. It allows you to easily install libraries like Jupyter, pandas, matplotlib, etc.

To check if pip is available:

```bash
pip --version
```

If not, follow the instructions at: [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### 3. **Install Jupyter Notebook**

Use pip to install Jupyter:

```bash
pip install notebook
```


### 4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**

Launch Jupyter by typing:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter in your browser.


## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### 🔹 `'jupyter' is not recognized`

Try:

```bash
python -m notebook
```

Or ensure your Python and Scripts folder is added to your PATH.

### 🔹 Admin or Permission Issues (Windows)

Right-click **Anaconda Prompt** or **Command Prompt** → choose **“Run as Administrator”**


## 📁 Organizing Your Notebooks and Files

When working with Jupyter, organizing your files is important! A messy folder makes it hard to manage projects.

We recommend:
- Using one folder per project
- Creating subfolders for `data`, `notebooks`, and `images`

## 🛑 How to Stop Jupyter Notebook

To shut down the Jupyter server:

```bash
Ctrl + C
```

Then type `Y` and press `Enter`
